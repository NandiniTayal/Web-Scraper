# Web-Scraper

### The project basically consists of both Web Crawler and Web Scraper:

#### WEB CRAWLER-
The spider can crawl any website by following the links.
Crawling basically involves generalised large scale retrieval of data from websites. 
As a sample I have crawled QuotestoScrape.com and stored the scraped data in html webpages.

#### WEB SCRAPER-
The spider can scrape selected data from website and store it in desired format.
Scraping is small-scale, specific and results in specialized dataset which can be stored in csv, json or any other format.

In addition to a simple scraper, a Link follower Scraper is designed which can follow the link to the next webpage and scrape the targeted data from it.
